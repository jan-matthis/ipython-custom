# Jupyter CSS

A minimal stylesheet for Jupyter ([Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jan-matthis/jupyter-css/master/screenshot.png)). Works with iPython 3.0. To use it: Edit the file `static/custom/custom.css` in the ipython notebook profile folder. By default, on a unix-based system, the profile folder is: `~/.ipython/profile_default`. `ipython locate` also returns the profile folder.
