# Jupyter CSS

A minimal stylesheet for [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) ([Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jan-matthis/jupyter-css/master/screenshot.png)). Works with IPython 3.0. 

To use it: Copy the contents of `custom.css` from this repository to the file `static/custom/custom.css` in your ipython notebook profile folder. By default, on a unix-based system, the profile folder is located at: `~/.ipython/profile_default`. Running `ipython locate` will also returns the path of the profile folder.
